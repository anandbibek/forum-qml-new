QML UI for maemo talk and meego forum

We had a very good app for our talk.maemo.org forum, created by ph5, who had done an amazing job
in carrying out such a huge task, that too, for free. Unfortunately,
some minor bugs and usability issues hampered daily use of this app, and the app deserved some maintenance.

Carrying over from http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php...hlight=tmo+app ,
This is forum-qml's new home, and the repo where the action is ;)
